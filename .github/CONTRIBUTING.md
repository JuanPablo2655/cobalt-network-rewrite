# Contributing

**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4Nn7UwX) instead of opening an issue.**

If you wish to contribute to the Cobalt Network codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
is a great boon to your development process.

## Setup

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **master** branch
2. Run `yarn --immutable`
3. Run `yarn prepare` to setup the git hooks
4. Code your heart out!
5. Run `yarn lint` to run ESLint and ensure any code changes are valid
6. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/JuanPablo2655/cobalt-network-rewrite/compare) (Make sure you follow the [conventional commit format](https://github.com/JuanPablo2655/cobalt-network-rewrite/blob/master/.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md))
